## ⚙️ Tech
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bootstrap-select](https://developer.snapappointments.com/bootstrap-select/)

The project is hosted on GitHub Pages that offers free hosting for static websites directly from the repository. Since GitHub Pages does not support any server-side scripting, a local SQLite database has been employed. Bootstrap is used for responsive styling, along with bootstrap-select. The site devoid of any server-side code works even when offline.🙃
