# Overview

This project hosts a website that displays the closing ranks of various colleges under JoSAA. It aims to provide an alternative, user-friendly platform to look up JoSSA cutoffs and help simplify college hunt before counselling.

One needs to enter their rank, apply custom filters such as preferred branch and get personalized results sorted in ascending order of closing rank.
